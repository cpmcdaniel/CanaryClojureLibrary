# clojure-plugin

This is a bare-bones Clojure plugin for CanaryMod. It starts up a REPL which can be connected to on a specific port (check the server logs on startup). This can be used as a playground to try things at the REPL. See the APIs in the *clojurepluginlib* for registering hooks, commands, and reloading the plugin (for when things inevitably get jacked-up).
